# Assignment 1 - MULT213 & COMP264

An assignment that uses JavaScript to generate website content about Nobel Prize recipients by reading JSON data and importing it.

<br>

## Project Goals and Execution

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to import JSON file data to be generated into content. Once imported and generated, the content needed structure and styling using HTML and CSS.

I created an on-hover transition effect on the data card using CSS that displays alternate information about each recipient. JavaScript was used to calculate and display some basic information on which year held the most laureates. All of the data on the page has been imported from a JSON file.

While creating this project I was learning to use local version control and commiting my progress along the way.
